# Sino keyboard app

This directory contains a small HTML5 web app that allows you to type Bopomofo and Pinyin.  This is necessary for using the phonetic query capability of Sino.

The app expects to find a webfont `bkai00mp.woff` in the same directory as the HTML file.  This webfont is defined within the CSS by the name `AR PL KaitiM Big5`, and then referenced elsewhere in the CSS.  You may substitute any CJK font you like.
