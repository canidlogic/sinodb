# Sino database datasets

This directory contains additional datasets.  These are supplements to the externally defined TCOFL, COCT, and CC-CEDICT datasets.

    level9.txt

This contains "level 9" words.  This is a plain-text file in UTF-8 format where there is one traditional Han rendering per line.  Each of these lines represents headwords that are neither in the TOCFL nor the COCT datasets, but which are referenced either directly or indirectly by cross-references in CC-CEDICT records relating to words in the TOCFL and COCT datasets.  This was generated by creating a Sino database without any level 9 words, and then running the `xrefwords.pl` reporting script to find all extra words that are cross-referenced but not already in the database.

    blocklist_79.txt

This contains the automatically generated blocklist for words in level range 7-9.  This is generated by first creating a Sino database without any blocklist applied, and then running the `nogloss.pl` reporting script with options `-level 7-9` and `-han`.  This is not the full blocklist.
